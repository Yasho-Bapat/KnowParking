# KnowParking

KnowParking is a service that will tell a user if there's enough parking spots available in a place before they go there. The idea is to supplement using Apple or Google Maps to check traffic data with parking data. 

The way this will work is, the service will have data about the amount of parking spots available in a particular city on a particular street, and it will collate data from other people who have parked in the same position and tell you whether there's enough places available on that road. 

It will understand whether a spot is occupied or not based on people who use the app - understanding where **you** park your car is a solved problem. We are not trying to solve that. We will _use_ that to build something better.
